# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, nothing fancy but might as well keep them open for anyone who might stumble upon them.

## .bashrc

Just a custommised PS1 created with ezprompt.net.

## .vimrc

My .vimrc which is decently commented to help me and anyone interested understand what is going on.
Uses vim-plug for plugins.
By no means complete and not in any way perfect. It just werks (TM), always a work in progress.

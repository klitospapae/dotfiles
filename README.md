# Dotfiles

my dotfiles, nothing fancy but might as well keep them open for anyone who might stumble upon them.

## setup.sh

script to create necessary links and dirs.

## .bashrc

Just a customised PS1 created with ezprompt.net.

## init.vim

neovim config which is decently commented to help me and anyone interested understand what is going on.
vim-plug for plugins.
by no means complete and not in any way perfect. It just werks (TM), always a work in progress.
